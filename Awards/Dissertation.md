# SIGPLAN John C. Reynolds Doctoral Dissertation Award

Presented annually to the author of the outstanding doctoral
dissertation in the area of Programming Languages. The award includes
a prize of $1,000. The winner can choose to receive the award at ICFP,
OOPSLA, POPL, or PLDI.

**Nominations**

Nominations must be submitted to the
[secretary](mailto:secretary_sigplan@acm.org) of SIGPLAN by January
5th 2014 to be considered for this year's award. The nominated dissertation
must be available in an English language version to facilitate
evaluation by the selection committee and have been awarded in the
year 2013.

A nomination should consist of the following items:

 *  Name, address, phone number, and email address of the person making the nomination (the nominator).
 *  Name, address, phone number, and email address of the candidate for whom an award is recommended (the nominee).
 *  A short statement (200-500 words) explaining why the nominee deserves the award in question. 
 *  Supporting statements from up to two people in addition to the nominator.

This award recognizes the contributions to computer science that John
C. Reynolds made during his life.  It is a renaming of the SIGPLAN
Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award to encourage the clarity and
rigor that Reynolds embodied and at the same time provide a reminder
of Reynolds's legacy and what a difference a person can make in the
field of programming language research.

Reynolds is renowned for a stunning list of deep technical contributions.

 * Gedanken, a core untyped language mixing functional and imperative features, which influenced Scheme
 * Defunctionalization, which gives principled ways of constructing compilers;
 * Polymorphic λ-calculus, a fundamental calculus of polymorphic functions, which influenced Java and C# generics;
 * Syntactic control of interference, which includes perhaps the earliest resource-oriented type system, prefiguring linear logic;
 * λ-calculus with subtypes, which is a foundational component of object-oriented type systems;
 * Idealized Algol, a core typed language for mixing imperative and functional features, similar in many respects to the subsequent approach to their mixture in Haskell;
 * Possible-world semantics for local state, which opened up a research area seeing considerable interest in foundational PL conferences in recent years;
 * Relational parametricity, a fundamental theory of data abstraction;
 * Separation logic, which extended Hoare’s logic to an effective treatment of mutable data structures, which led to many proof tools for programs in realistic languages.
 
Reynolds’ work underlies a staggering amount of programming language
research and he was an inspiration to all he worked with. He was well
known for helping colleagues and students work through ideas.
