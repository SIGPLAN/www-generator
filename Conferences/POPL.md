**Recommendations to POPL Program Committee chairs**

The aim of the following recommendations to POPL Program Committee
chairs is to avoid some known pitfalls in the paper selection
process. While not required except where noted, the recommendations
are based on the experience of the POPL Steering Committee.
It is recommended that the PC chair:
-   forbid the PC chair from co-authoring a paper (a SIGPLAN
    requirement),
-   forbid the general chair from co-authoring a paper,
-   forbid submissions authored exclusively by PC members,
-   hold PC papers to a higher standard; one practice that has
    worked well is to accept a PC paper only if it falls into the
    'accept without discussion' category; any significant doubt or
    disagreement indicates rejection,
-   ensure that any authors leave the room during any detailed
    discussion of their paper; and refrain from comment (of any kind)
    if their paper is referred to at other times, and
-   if using the author-response option, then exclude PC papers
    from the response period so the PC member doesn't get to see the
    reviews of his/her paper in advance of the meeting.
