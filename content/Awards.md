**Programming Languages Software Award**  
The
[Programming Languages Software Award](Awards/Software/Main) is
awarded to an institution or individual(s) to recognize the
development a software system that has had a significant impact on
programming language research, implementations, and tools. The
impact may be reflected in the wide-spread adoption of the system
or its underlying concepts by the wider programming language
community either in research projects, in the open-source
community, or commercially.The award includes a prize of $2,500.

**Robin Milner Young Researcher Award**  
The
[Robin Milner Young Researcher Award](Awards/Milner/Main) is awarded
to recognize outstanding contributions by young investigators in
