title: "2008: Barbara Liskov"

> **Citation**
> 
> "Professor Barbara Liskov has had tremendous impact on the fields
> of programming languages, operating systems, distributed systems,
> and information security. Much of her early research focus was on
> data abstraction, modularity, and encapsulation as typified by the
> CLU programming language. At the time, CLU incorporated a number of
> advanced features, such as modular encapsulation of abstract data
> types, bounded polymorphism, exceptions, and iterator abstraction
> that had clear influence over successive languages including Ada,
> Modula-3, C++, and Java. Through CLU, the related books and
> articles, her work on behavioral subtyping, and her courses on
> programming methodology, Professor Liskov changed the way that a
> generation of engineers thought about and constructed large
> software systems. Professor Liskov's work on the Argus project also
> brought to the fore the idea of integrating transactions and
> orthogonal persistence into a programming language with an aim
> towards building reliable distributed systems. More recently, her
> work on information flow control helped to start a research focus
> on end-to-end security using language-based mechanisms for
> enforcement."
