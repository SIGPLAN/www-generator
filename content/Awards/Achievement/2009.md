title: "2009: Rod Burstall"

> **Citation**
> 
> "Professor Rod Burstall has made deep, seminal contributions to the
> design of programming languages and the field of program
> verification. These contributions, which many of us now take for
> granted, include the introduction of algebraic datatypes coupled
> with pattern-matching clausal function definitions as found in
> Hope, ML, Haskell and Coq; the generalization and use of structural
> induction for proving properties of programs; the fold-unfold
> method for deriving efficient, provably-correct programs from easy
> to understand prototypes; mechanisms for reasoning about
> pointer-based, imperative programs that directly led to the
> development of separation logic; proof techniques and connections
> to modal logic for reasoning about concurrent programs; and the use
> of dependent types and algebraic specifications for constructing
> module systems that directly influenced SML and OCaml. Through
> these amazing contributions and his collaborations and mentorship,
> he helped build one of the most important centers of programming
> research at Edinburgh, which was eventually institutionalized as
> the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science."
