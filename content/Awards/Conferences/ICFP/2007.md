> "Functional Reactive Animation" by Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak was
> the first published paper on functional reactive programming. It
> described a collection of data types and functions that comprised
> an embedded domain-specific language called Fran for composing
> interactive, multi-media animations. The key abstractions were
> first-class behaviors and events. Intuitively, a behavior is a
> value that varies with continuous time while an event is a discrete
> counterpart including time-varying predicates. The idea of
> regarding the entire lifetime of a time-varying quantity as a
> single first-class value was new and very surprising at the time,
> but the paper made it seem simple and obvious. The insight in the
> paper led to a significant number of follow-on projects including
> FranTk, Fruit, Pidgets, FrTime, Frob, FRP, Frappe, Frag, Fvision,
> Yampa, Feris, and work on embodying financial contracts in
> functional terms.
