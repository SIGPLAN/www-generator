> Lennart Augustsson's 1998 ICFP Paper &#8220;Cayenne: A language with
> dependent types&#8221; made dependently-typed programming accessible to
> non-type theorists. The language design was a bold one, both in its
> use of dependent types and in its adoption of an undecidable type
> system. Although the idea seemed quite radical at the time, it
> allowed future work to break out of the straight-jacket of
> decidable type systems. It also pointed the way towards the merger
> of programming languages and proof systems that we are starting to
> see today in languages such as Agda.
