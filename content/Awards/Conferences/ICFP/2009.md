> Malcolm Wallace and Colin Runciman's 1999 ICFP paper "Haskell and
> XML: Generic combinators or type-based translation?" was one of the
> first papers to spell out the close connection between functional
> programming languages and XML. It described a typed correspondence
> between XML's document type definitions (DTD) and Haskell
> datatypes. This correspondence leads to a natural representation of
> XML data in functional languages and permits native functions to
> operate on this representation. The paper also describes a generic
> encoding of XML trees together with a combinator language for
> querying and transforming the XML. The paper led to a widespread
> awareness of the close connection between XML and functional
> programming and initiated a flurry of research on functional XML
> processing. Moreover,  
> the accompanying implementation was widely distributed as part of a
> CD with various XML tools, thus making an impact in the problem
> domain beyond the functional programming community: a perfect
> example of functional programming solving real world problems.
