> This paper presented a very simple but powerful system for testing
> Haskell programs that has had significant impact on the practice of
> debugging programs in Haskell. The paper describes a clever way to
> use type classes and monads to automatically generate random test
> data. QuickCheck has since become an extremely popular Haskell
> library that is widely used by programmers, and has been
> incorporated into many undergraduate courses in Haskell. The
> techniques described in the paper have spawned a significant body
> of follow-on work in test case generation. They have also been
> adapted to other languages, leading to their commercialisation for
> Erlang and C.
