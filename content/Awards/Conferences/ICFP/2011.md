> Various attempts at extending ML modules with recursions were made starting in the early 90's. However, they all ran into a nasty typing issue later dubbed the "double-vision problem" by Derek Dreyer. Russo's ICFP 2001 paper was the first to propose a correct and practical solution to this problem. The solution played very cleverly on the nonstandard formalization of ML modules developed in his thesis. Building on this novel insight, the ICFP 2001 paper develops a complete design for recursive modules in ML, which Russo implemented in Moscow ML and which is complete enough to handle many desirable examples. Russo's design was the main source of inspiration for adding recursive modules in OCaml, taking recursive modules from an open research issue to a realised language feature that simply works.
