In their 1997 OOPSLA paper "Call Graph Construction in
Object-Oriented Languages," David Grove, Greg DeFouw, Jeffrey Dean,
and Craig Chambers studied the existing algorithms for call-graph
construction in object-oriented languages and brought them together
into a unified framework. This framework is both theoretical,
allowing the authors to compare the precision of the different
algorithms, and also practical in that they built a single
parameterized implementation of all of the algorithms. This
implementation allowed them to conduct a thorough empirical
evaluation of the algorithms, which had not been previously
possible because the algorithms had been implemented separately and
applied to different programs. In the process, the authors
discovered and evaluated a few new variations suggested by their
framework. This kind of consolidation paper is important for moving
the field forward since it provides theoretical models to build on
and performance evaluations as benchmarks. It has served as a model
for later work of this kind.
