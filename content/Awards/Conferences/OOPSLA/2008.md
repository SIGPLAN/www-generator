In their 1998 OOPSLA paper, "Ownership Types for Flexible
Protection," David Clark, John Potter, and James Nobel introduced
the notion of "ownership types" to control inter-object aliasing
statically, making it easier to reason about the dynamic topology
of an object-oriented program. This work is part of the broader
trend of trying to handle issues of isolation and modularity while
retaining expressiveness.
