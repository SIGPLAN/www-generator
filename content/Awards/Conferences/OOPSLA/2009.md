The 1999 OOPSLA paper "Implementing Jalape&#241;o in Java" describes how
the authors implemented a Java Virtual Machine in the Java
language. This system, which was eventually renamed the Jikes RVM
and released to the public, enabled a whole range of academic and
industrial research in virtual machines that would have been
difficult or impossible otherwise. To this day, researchers
successfully use the Jikes RVM as a platform for new
investigations.
