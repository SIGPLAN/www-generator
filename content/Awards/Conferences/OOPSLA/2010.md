>  The 2000 OOPSLA paper "Adaptive Optimization in the Jalape&#241;o JVM"
   describes the architecture of adaptive optimization in what is now
   known as the Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine), continuing a
   line of research in dynamic adaptive optimizing compilers including
   Self and Animorphic (later HotSpot). The novelty of this paper was
   its use of continuous sampling to obtain execution statistics for
   optimized as well as unoptimized code. Also, because Jikes RVM is
   written entirely in Java, the techniques apply not only to the
   application but also to the VM and its components. Follow-on work
   has used, refined, and extended upon this adaptive optimization
   infrastructure. The paper has inspired significant further
   innovation in dynamic profiling and remains a primary reference for
   its exposition of the basic ingredients of adaptive optimization
   for modern VM-based languages.
