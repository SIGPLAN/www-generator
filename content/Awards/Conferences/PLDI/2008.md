> "The 1998 PLDI paper "Implementation of the Cilk-5 Multithreaded
> Language" by Matteo Frigo, Charles E. Leiserson, and Keith H.
> Randall introduced an efficient form of thread-local deques to
> control scheduling of multithreaded programs. This innovation not
> only opened the way to faster and simpler runtimes for fine-grained
> parallelism, but also provided a basis for simpler parallel
> recursive programming techniques that elegantly extend those of
> sequential programming. The stack-like side of a deque acts just
> like a standard procedure stack, while the queue side enables
> breadth-first work-stealing by other threads. The work-stealing
> techniques introduced in this paper are beginning to influence
> common practice, such as the Intel Threading Building Blocks
> project, an upcoming standardized fork-join framework for Java, and
> a variety of projects at Microsoft."
