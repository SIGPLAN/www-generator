> "The 1999 PLDI paper &#8220;A Fast Fourier Transform Compiler&#8221; by Matteo
> Frigo describes the implementation of *genfft*, a special-purpose
> compiler that produces the performance critical code for a library,
> called FFTW (the &#8220;Fastest Fourier Transform in the West&#8221;), that
> computes the discrete Fourier transform. FFTW is the predominant
> open fast Fourier transform package available today, as it has been
> since its introduction a decade ago. *genfft* demonstrated the
> power of domain-specific compilation&#8212;FFTW achieves the best or
> close to best performance on most machines, which is remarkable for
> a single package. By encapsulating expert knowledge from the FFT
> algorithm domain and the compiler domain, *genfft* and FFTW provide
> a tremendous service to the scientific and technical community by
> making highly efficient FFTs available to everyone on any machine.
> As well as being the fastest FFT in the West, FFTW may be the last
> FFT in the West as the quality of this package and the maturity of
> the field may mean that it will never be superseded, at least for
> computer architectures similar to past and current ones."
