> The paper, "Automatic Predicate Abstraction of C Programs" by
> Thomas Ball, Rupak Majumdar, Todd D. Millstein, and Sriram K.
> Rajamani presented the underlying predicate abstraction technology
> of the SLAM project for checking that software satisfies critical
> behavioral properties of the interfaces it uses and to aid software
> engineers in designing interfaces and software that ensure reliable
> and correct execution. The technology is now part of Microsoft's
> Static Driver Verifier in the Windows Driver Development Kit. This
> is one of the earliest examples of automation of software
> verification on a large scale and the basis for numerous efforts to
> expand the domains that can be verified."
