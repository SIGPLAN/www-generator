> This paper marks a turning point in the field of static checking, describing pragmatic design decisions that promote practicality over completeness. Pioneered in ESC/Modula-3, techniques from ESC/Java are now widely used in various forms in Microsoft&#8217;s development tools, notably as part of Code Contracts which ships with VisualStudio.  Recent innovations strongly influenced by ESC/Java include refinement types for Haskell, and verification of Eiffel programs.
