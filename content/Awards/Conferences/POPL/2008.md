> "From System F to Typed Assembly Language" by Greg Morrisett, David
> Walker, Karl Crary, and Neal Glew began a major development in the 
> application of type system ideas to low level programming.  The
> paper shows how to compile a high-level, statically typed language
> into TAL, a typed assembly language defined by the authors. The
> type system for the assembly language ensures that source-level
> abstractions like closures and polymorphic functions are enforced
> at the machine-code level while permitting aggressive, low-level
> optimizations such as register allocation and instruction
> scheduling. This infrastructure provides the basis for ensuring the
> safety of untrusted low-level code artifacts, regardless of their
> source.  A large body of subsequent work has drawn on the ideas in
> this paper, including work on proof-carrying code and certifying
> compilers.
