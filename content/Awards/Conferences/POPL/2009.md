> "JFlow: Practical Mostly-Static Information Flow Control" by Andrew
> C. Myers demonstrated the practicality of using static information
> flow analysis to protect privacy and preserve integrity by giving
> an efficient information flow type checker for an extension of the
> widely-used Java language. The work has had a significant impact
> both within and beyond the programming language community. In
> particular, subsequent work for other languages has largely
> followed the path laid out in this paper, and the compiler
> infrastructure developed for JFlow (now called Jif) is widely used
> as a research platform. Furthermore, using the JFlow work as a
> basis, several major research initiatives are investigating the
> challenges of building complex, real-world systems with
> confidentiality guarantees.
