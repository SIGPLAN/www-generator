> "Anytime, Anywhere: Modal Logics for Mobile Ambients" by Luca
> Cardelli and Andrew D. Gordon helped spur a flowering of work in
> the area of process calculi that continues today. The paper focused
> on modal logics for reasoning about both temporal and spacial
> modalities for ambient behaviours, demonstrating techniques that
> also apply to other process calculi (even those without an explicit
> notion of location), so contributing to excitement in an area that
> was growing at that time and continues. The work has led to
> application of concurrency theory in fields as diverse as security,
> safety critical applications, query languages for semistructured
> data, and systems biology.
