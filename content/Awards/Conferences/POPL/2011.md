> In applying the logic of bunched implications (BI) to mutable data
> structures this paper laid the groundwork for the flowering of
> separation logic (heap models of separation logic are specific BI
> models), which allows reasoning about programs with dynamically
> allocated (and deallocated) memory.  This paper introduced the
> 'frame rule' which supports local reasoning in separation logic,
> where specifications and proofs concentrate on just those memory
> cells manipulated by a program component rather than the entire
> global program state.  Separation logic underlies continuing
> research on what is described as local reasoning, having diverse
> application in domains such as program verification and automated
> parallelization.
