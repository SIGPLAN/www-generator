> This paper showed a path to taking legacy C code and 
> making it safer, by adding type safety guarantees to 
> existing C programs. It uses a combination of static 
> and dynamic techniques to allow programmers to conduct 
> low-level operations while guaranteeing safety properties 
> regarding pointers and minimizing overhead. For many 
> C programs, CCured&#8217;s type inference is able to infer 
> that most or all of the pointers are statically verifiable 
> to be type safe. This paper demonstrates the beauty of 
> both dynamic and static types, influencing the design 
> of languages such as C#, and inspiring continuing 
> research on static and dynamic analysis.
