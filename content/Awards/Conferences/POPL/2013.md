> Languages with automatic memory management offer well-known advantages
> in terms of software engineering, but the use of garbage collection
> seemed for a long time to place such languages off-limits for hard
> real-time and embedded systems.  Indeed, prior to this highly
> influential paper, the existing approaches to real-time garbage
> collection suffered from a number of practical problems: a lack of
> hard bounds on pause times in the face of fragmentation or large data
> structures; high space overhead due to the use of copying collection
> to avoid fragmentation; and uneven mutator utilization due to the use
> of work-based scheduling algorithms.  Bacon, Cheng & Rajan's paper
> showed how to overcome all these problems in the design of a *real*
> real-time garbage collector for Java.  The collector, which was
> implemented and tested in the Jikes RVM, employed an impressive
> variety of techniques, such as time-based scheduling and "mostly
> non-moving" collection, in order to provide guaranteed pause times,
> consistent mutator utilization, and low space overhead.  In short, the
> paper marked a major advance toward the important goal of turning hard
> real-time garbage collection into a reality.
