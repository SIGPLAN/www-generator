> "Dynamic slicing is a technique for determining which variables and
> data structures affected values causing a fault (bug) at a
> particular location in a particular run of a program, thus allowing
> a programmer to work backwards to determine the ultimate cause of a
> fault. Previously this approach was too expensive to use in
> practice. Zhang has improved the performance by orders of
> magnitude, making it practical. The committee believes this work
> will have considerable impact and value in practice."
