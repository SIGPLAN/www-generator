> "The thesis explores a formalism called nested trees, that can
> represent complex branching behavior (loops and recursion) and
> support modular statement of context-sensitive correctness
> conditions. It further makes a specific technical contribution by
> offering the first algorithm for reachability in in nested trees
> that is sub-cubic in performance. The committee believes this work
> has great potential for long-term utility."
