> > "This dissertation makes several significant contributions to the
> > problems of tracking down and tolerating software errors in
> > deployed systems. It proposes a variety of techniques, ranging from
> > a breakthrough, probabilistic method of compactly representing
> > calling contexts, to novel techniques for tracking null pointers,
> > to garbage collector modifications that let programs tolerate
> > memory leaks. The evaluation committee was impressed by Michael's
> > fresh perspective on these problems and the thorough experimental
> > evaluation by which he backs up his claims. His research has
> > already had broad adoption and impact, and we believe that his
> > techniques will be brought to bear on a wide range of future
> > applications."

> > "This dissertation introduces a novel logic for reasoning about
> > concurrent shared-memory programs. This logic subsumes both
> > rely/guarantee reasoning and separation logic in an elegant and
> > natural manner. The dissertation establishes the semantic
> > properties of the logic and demonstrates its applicability on a
> > range of highly complex concurrent algorithms and data structures.
> > The evaluation committee found the clarity of Viktor's presentation
> > and the technical depth of his results particularly compelling, and
> > we believe that this work creates a foundation for new tools and
> > automated techniques for reasoning about concurrent programs."
