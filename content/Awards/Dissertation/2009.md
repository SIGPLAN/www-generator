> [Akash Lal](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/akashl/), University of Wisconsin.
> > *Interprocedural Analysis and the Verification of Concurrent Programs*  
> > Advisor: Thomas Reps
> > 
> > **Citation**
> > 
> > "This dissertation develops improvements to interprocedural program
> > analysis through context-bounded analysis and through Lal's
> > extended weighted push down systems, which generalize weighted push
> > down systems to handle local variables. The dissertation describes
> > both algorithms and experiments, and it shows, for example, a
> > 30-fold speedup over existing algorithms for analyzing concurrent
> > programs. The members of the award committee were impressed by the
> > unusual scope and depth of the dissertation and its excellent
> > presentation."  

> [William Thies](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/thies/), Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
> > *Language and Compiler Support for Stream Programs*  
> > Advisor: Saman Amarasinghe
> > 
> > **Citation**
> > 
> > "This dissertation describes the StreamIt synchronous dataflow
> > language, for which Thies led the definition. The language supports
> > several novel constructs, notably teleport messaging. Thies's
> > dissertation includes a technique for processing compressed video
> > data, and it also describes dynamic analysis techniques to convert
> > legacy C applications to streaming applications. The members of the
> > award committee were impressed with the novelty, interdisciplinary
> > nature, and breadth of the work, the care given to evaluation, and
> > the quality of the presentation."

> > Selection commmittee: John Cavazos, Satish Chandra, Matthew Flatt,
> > Jeff Foster, Simon Gay, Cristina Lopes, Shaz Qadeer, Scott Stoller,
