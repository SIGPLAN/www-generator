> "This dissertation makes several significant contributions to the
> field of parallel and concurrent programming. The main technical
> contribution is a type and effect system that enables reasoning
> about non-interference at a fine granularity. A second contribution
> is support for non-deterministic code sections that are explicitly
> marked as such. A third contribution is support for object-oriented
> frameworks, where user extensions are guaranteed to adhere to the
> framework's effect restrictions. These contributions are backed by
> formal models, soundness proofs, and the Deterministic Parallel
> Java implementation. Evaluation shows that highly satisfactory
> speedups can be achieved on interesting code bases, sometimes
> beating the performance of hand-crafted implementations. The
> members of the award committee were impressed by the quality of the
> work and the clarity of the presentation."
