This dissertation addresses the problem of obtaining reliable results
from concurrent programs. As a first step, the dissertation presents
LiteRace, which uses sampling to dynamically detect race
conditions. As a second step, the dissertation presents DRFx, which is
a memory model that enforces sequential consistency, where hardware
and software share responsibility for detecting violations of
sequential consistency. Finally, the dissertation presents the design
of an optimizing compiler that preserves sequential consistency. The
dissertation thus demonstrates how a revised distribution of
responsibilities among programmers, programming languages, and
hardware can help detect and avoid concurrency violations. The
committee was impressed with the dissertation's broad vision for both
the problems of concurrency and the possible solutions.
