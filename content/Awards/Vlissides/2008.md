title: "2008: Ciera Jaspan, Carnegie Mellon University"
---
Ciera Jaspan's research targets the programming difficulties
associated with using software frameworks. Plug-in writers need to
satisfy a variety of framework constraints, and Ciera is directly
motivated by the kinds of plug-in errors that frequently arise in
today's frameworks. She has defined a new abstraction for
expressing framework constraints as well as lightweight annotations
and an associated static analysis to enforce this abstraction.
Ciera is focused on making the right tradeoffs to ensure her
solution is useful in practice.
