title: "2009: Tudor Dumitras, Carnegie Mellon University"
---
Tudor Dumitras's research identifies and addresses the leading
causes of both unplanned failures and planned downtime resulting
from software upgrades in distributed systems. Traditional
fault-tolerance approaches concentrate almost entirely on
responding to, avoiding, or tolerating unexpected faults or
security violations. However, scheduled events such as software
upgrades account for most system unavailability and often introduce
data loss or latent errors. Tudor defines three abstract properties
required for improving the dependability of software upgrades.
Building on empirically derived insights on current upgrade
practices and problems, Tudor's work harnesses the opportunities
provided by emerging technologies such as cloud computing to
simplify large-scale upgrades, to allow upgrades to be executed
efficiently online, and to improve their dependability.
