>  M&#225;rcio Ribeiro's research addresses the problem of maintaining
   software defined using "virtual separation of concerns." The
   virtual separation of concerns technique presents software with
   features defined using code between \#ifdef and \#endif (as in the
   C preprocessor) to the programmer in a way that hides various
   features that are not of immediate interest. However, when
   maintaining such software, it is easy to break code in hidden
   features. The solution approach uses a specialized dataflow
   analysis that takes features and allowed feature combinations into
   account. The results of this analysis are used to warn the
   programmer if there are dependencies between the changed code and
   any hidden features. These ideas are being implemented in a tool
   that will allow independent development of parallel features.
