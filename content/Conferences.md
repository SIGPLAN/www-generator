title: "SIGPLAN Conferences"
---
SIGPLAN [sponsors](Resources/Proposals/Sponsorship) or co-sponsors
the premier conferences in the area of programming language
research, providing the opportunity for researchers, developers,
practitioners, and students to present the latest research
advances. The conferences listed on this page are sponsored by
SIGPLAN.
ACM maintains a
[master conference calendar](http://campus.acm.org/calendar/index.cfm?Sponsor=SIGPLAN)
for SIGPLAN.

SIGPLAN also supports conferences through
[in-cooperation](Resources/Proposals/Cooperated) status.
Links to these conferences can be found [here](Resources/Events/Cooperated).  

* * * * *

**Programming Language Design and Implementation ([PLDI](Conferences/PLDI/Main))**  
Programming Language Design and Implementation is the premier forum
for research on programming language design and implementation.

**Principles of Programming Languages ([POPL](Conferences/POPL/Main))**   
Principles of Programming Languages is the premier forum for the
fundamental innovations in design, definition, analysis,
transformation, and implementation of programming languages,
programming systems, and programming abstractions.

**OOPSLA ([SPLASH](Conferences/OOPSLA/Main))**  
SPLASH is the premier conference for industry and and academic
experts to report innovations in object technology, programmer
productivity, secure and reliable software, and ultra-large scale
systems.

**International Conference on Functional Programming ([ICFP](Conferences/ICFP/Main))**    
The International Conference on Functional Programming is the
premier forum for the design, implementations, and uses of
functional programming.

**Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems&#160;([LCTES](Conferences/LCTES/Main))**  
LCTES provides a link between the programming languages and
embedded systems engineering communities. Researchers and
developers in these areas are addressing many similar problems, but
with different backgrounds and approaches. LCTES is intended to
expose researchers and developers from either area to relevant work
and interesting problems in the other area and provide a forum
where they can interact.

**Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems ([ASPLOS](Conferences/ASPLOS/Main))**  
The International Conference on Architectural Support for
Programming Languages and Operating Systems provides a high-quality
forum for scientists and engineers to present their latest research
findings in these rapidly changing fields. It has captured some of
the major computer systems innovations of the past 15 years (e.g.,
RISC and VLIW processors, small and large-scale multiprocessors,
clusters and networks-of-workstations, optimizing compilers, RAID,
and network-storage system designs). ASPLOS is co-sponsored with
[SIGARCH](http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigarch/) and
[SIGOPS](http://www.sigops.org/).&#160; 

**International Symposium on Memory Management ([ISMM](Conferences/ISMM/Main))**
The International Symposium on Memory Management, focuses on
garbage collection, dynamic storage allocation, storage management
implementation techniques, plus interactions with languages and
operating systems, and empirical studies of programs' memory
allocation and referencing behavior.  

**Virtual Execution Environments ([VEE](Conferences/VEE/Main))**  
The goal of the International Conference on Virtual Execution
Environments is to be a first-rate research forum that brings
together leading practitioners and researchers in the broad area of
virtualization, which includes topics such as high-level language
virtual machines (JVM, CLR, etc.), process and system virtual
machines, translators, machine emulators, and simulators.
Previously, research results on these topics have been scattered
among a number of different venues in the languages (VM, PLDI,
OOPSLA, IVME), operating systems (SOSP, OSDI, USENIX), and
architecture (ASPLOS, CGO, PACT) communities.

**Principles and Practices of Parallel Programming ([PPOPP](Conferences/PPOPP/Main))**  
Principles and Practices of Parallel Programming provides a forum
for papers on the principles and foundations of parallel
programming, tools and techniques for parallel programming, and
experiences in using parallel programming to solve applications
problems.

**History of Programming Languages ([HOPL](http://research.ihost.com/hopl/HOPL.html))**  
The goal of the History of Programming Languages conference is to
produce an accurate historical record of programming language
design and development. HOPL-III will be held in 2007 in San Diego,
CA as part of FCRC 2007. HOPL-III is in-cooperation with
[SIGSOFT](http://www.sigsoft.org/).
HOPL-I was held in 1978 in Los Angeles, CA. HOPL-II was held in
1993 in Cambridge, MA.

**Haskell Symposium ([HS](http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/))**  
The Haskell Symposium is an annual symposium organized in
affiliation with the International Conference on Functional
Programming (ICFP). The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to
discuss experience with Haskell, and future developments for the
language. The scope of the symposium includes all aspects of the
design, semantics, theory, application, implementation, and
teaching of Haskell.

**Code Generation and Optimization ([CGO](http://www.cgo.org))**  
The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization
(CGO) provides a premier venue to bring together researchers and
practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on
a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and
related issues. The conferences spans the spectrum from purely
static to fully dynamic approaches, including techniques ranging
from pure software-based methods to architectural features and
support.

**Generative Programming: Concepts and Experiences ([GPCE](http://program-transformation.org/Gpce))**  
Generative Programming: Concepts &amp; Experiences is a conference promoting the application and innovation of foundational techniques for supporting automatic program generation.

**Onward! ([Onward](Conferences/Onward/Main))**  
Onward! is a symposium on new ideas in programming and reflections on software. Welcomed are papers that propose and argue for new approaches to the creation of software as well as reflections on technology and ideas bearing on programming broadly construed.

**Dynamic Languages Symposium ([DLS](Conferences/DLS/Main))**  
The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is a forum for discussion of dynamic languages, their implementation, and application.

***The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop ([PLMW](Conferences/PLMW/Main))***  
The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage graduate students (PhD and MSc) and senior undergraduate students to pursue careers in programming language research. This workshop will provide technical sessions on cutting-edge research in programming languages, and mentoring sessions on how to prepare for a research career. We will bring together leaders in programming language research from academia and industry to give talks on their research areas. The workshop will engage students in a process of imagining how they might contribute to our research community.
