title: "Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop"
---
The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage graduate students (PhD and MSc) and senior undergraduate students to pursue careers in programming language research. This workshop will provide technical sessions on cutting-edge research in programming languages, and mentoring sessions on how to prepare for a research career. We will bring together leaders in programming language research from academia and industry to give talks on their research areas. The workshop will engage students in a process of imagining how they might contribute to our research community.

We especially encourage women and underrepresented minority students to attend PLMW. Since this year's workshop will be in Rome, we particularly look forward to seeing Eastern European students at the workshop.
