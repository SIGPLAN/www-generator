>  (from 2002) Reconsidering Custom Memory Allocation

>  **Citation**

> Custom memory management is often used in systems software for the
  purpose of decreasing the cost of allocation and tightly controlling
  memory footprint of the software. Until 2002, it was taken for granted
  that application-specific memory allocators were superior to general
  purpose libraries. Berger, Zorn and McKinley's paper demonstrated
  through a rigorous empirical study that this assumption is not
  well-founded, and gave insights into the reasons why general purpose
  allocators can outperform handcrafted ones. The paper also stands out
  for the quality of its empirical methodology.
