title: "2013: Kathleen Fisher"
---
Kathleen Fisher served on the SIGPLAN Executive committee for twelve years, from 2001 to 2012, taking on in succession the roles of member-at-large, vice-chair, chair, and past chair.  During that time she worked tirelessly to promote programming languages among researchers and students.  She has served as program chair for many major conferences, including ICFP 2004, CUFP 2006, FOOL/WOOD 2006-7, OOPSLA and SPLASH 2011.  Kathleen has also served on the board of the CRA, co-chaired CRA's Committee on the Status of Women, and edited the Journal of Functional Programming.  She chairs the PLDI steering committee, and will be general chair for ICFP 2015.

When Kathleen sees a problem, she takes action to fix it.  For example, seeing that programming languages were being neglected in Computer Science curriculum recommendations, she spearheaded an influential workshop and community effort that led to an increased role for programming languages in the ACM Curriculum, including new emphasis on polymorphism, higher-order functions, type systems, static analysis, and garbage collection.  Concerned that students were not entering programming languages research, she, in collaboration with Ron Garcia and Stephanie Weirich, organized and secured funding for the first Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop, held at POPL in Philadelphia in 2012, and is helping to ensure the continuation of this event by serving on its steering committee.

Kathleen's enthusiasm for programming languages, and for life, prompted many of today's volunteers to take the first steps toward involvement in SIGPLAN affairs.  The Executive Committee misses her wit, wisdom and guidance, but feels that she has truly earned the 2013 Distinguished Service Award.
