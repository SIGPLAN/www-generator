This is the first publication to describe the design, implementation, and optimization of the language nesC, which is a variant of the C programming language especially well suited to the programming of embedded systems.  Much as the C programming language made possible the development of UNIX, so has nesC made possible the development of TinyOS.  A decade hence, nesC is still the language of choice for developing applications under TinyOS on "motes" and other embedded systems platforms.  Central to the design of nesC and TinyOS is the notion of an asynchronous, or non-blocking, call.  This form of software architecture nicely accommodates the timing uncertainties and failures experienced by embedded systems applications in the real world.  The success and longevity of nesC can be attributed to its precise and useful formulations of concurrency, atomicity, and modularization with regard to its intended application audience.  These formulations allow for efficient implementations while offering encapsulation mechanisms that encourage software sharing and reuse.  The nesC paper has amassed hundreds of citations, and the language continues to be in widespread use for teaching, research, and industry in the embedded systems community.
