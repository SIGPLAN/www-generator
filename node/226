> Le Botlan and R&#233;my's paper on MLF presented a major technical
breakthrough in type inference for first-class polymorphism.
Remarkably, by going from ML to a system that is more expressive than
System F, principal types could be recovered.  The paper was the first
and only paper (to date) to present a type inference and unification
algorithm with all the "good" features of ordinary ML inference and
unification, except on a richer universe of types and constraints that
allowed impredicative instantiation.  The MLF system enjoys most
general unifiers, completeness properties, and robustness under
program transformations, with user type annotations providing the
oracles needed to reach the expressiveness of System F and beyond.
The MLF paper has been highly influential on subsequent work in type
inference for first-class polymorphism, and is a must-read for anyone
interested in the topic.
