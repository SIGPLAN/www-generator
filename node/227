> Interpolation can be used to construct an inductive invariant for a
> transition system that is strong enough to prove a given property.
> Prior to Henzinger et al.'s paper, interpolation had only been applied
> to model checking of finite-state systems.  In this paper, the
> authors demonstrated a fundamental generalization of Craig
> interpolation to program analysis by predicate abstraction, opening
> the door for interpolation to be applied to abstraction refinement of
> infinite-state systems.  This work showed how interpolation offers a
> fundamental way to explain abstraction refinement in a logical
> framework and has led to many extensions to increase the power of
> abstraction in program analysis.
