Maged Michael's PLDI'04 paper is considered a landmark in memory
allocation for multithreaded programs, presenting the first completely
lock-free general-purpose user-space allocator.  It provides good
performance with respect to scalability, speed and space efficiency,
while at the same time only relying on common hardware and OS support.
The work is highly regarded and frequently referenced, and is also the
basis of multiple memory allocator implementations, both in IBM
products and in follow-on research.
