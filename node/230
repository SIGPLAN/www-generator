Understanding and Expressing Scalable Concurrency

Aaron Turon's dissertation makes several major contributions to the
design, implementation, and verification of scalable concurrent
programs.  First, the dissertation presents "reagents", a high-level
language of combinators for designing---and *composing*---lock-free
data structures.  Second, the dissertation shows how lock-free data
structures can be used to scalably implement Fournet and Gonthier's
join calculus, in a newly re-engineered C# library that significantly
outperforms prior lock-based implementations.  Third, the dissertation
develops powerful theoretical foundations---based on logical relations
and separation logic---for verifying the correctness of scalable
concurrent algorithms via contextual refinement.  The members of the
award committee were impressed with both the breadth and depth of the
work, as well as the elegance of the exposition.
