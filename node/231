title: "2014: The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)"
---
The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) provides a portable, 
production-quality, standards-compliant, highly optimizing compiler, 
supporting more architectures, programming languages, and operating 
environments than any other comparable tool.  It provides the 
toolchain that underpins all of the GNU/Linux distributions, popular 
websites, and embedded environments. 

GCC provides the foundation for numerous experiments in programming 
language design, including the early C++ language, numerous evolutions 
of the C and C++ standards, parallel programming with OpenMP, and the 
Go programming language.  GCC has been used by many research projects, 
leading to high-impact publications and contributions to the 
development trunk, including sophisticated instruction selection based 
on declarative machine descriptions, auto-tuning techniques, 
transactional memory, and polyhedral loop nest optimizations. 

GCC is the product of hundreds of person-years of work over its 27 
years of existence. This award recognizes the GCC developer community 
for the substantial impact it has had on the programming language 
community and the larger software industry.
